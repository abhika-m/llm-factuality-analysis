The amphitheater is elliptical in shape, and measures 188 meters (617 feet) in length and 156 meters (512 feet) in width, with a base area of 24,000 square meters (258,000 square feet). It could seat up to 50,000 spectators, making it one of the largest public venues in the ancient world. The amphitheater was used for gladiatorial contests, public spectacles, and theatrical performances. It is now a major tourist attraction in Rome, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.",

It was the first ALCO road switcher locomotive, and was designed to replace steam locomotives in both freight and passenger service.\n\nThe RS-3 was powered by an ALCO 539 prime mover, a V-12 engine rated at 1,500 horsepower. It was equipped with a D-27 traction motor, which provided a maximum speed of 65 mph. The locomotive was built with a B-B wheel arrangement, and had a wheelbase of 40 feet.\n\nThe RS-3 was designed to be a versatile locomotive, and was used in both freight and passenger service. It was used by many railroads, including the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, the Chicago and North Western Railway, and the Union Pacific Railroad.\n\nThe RS-3 was a popular locomotive, and over 1,500 units were built between 1950 and 1956. It was eventually replaced by the ALCO RS-11, which was introduced in 1956.",

It was powered by a combination of solid and liquid propellants. The first stage was powered by a solid propellant, while the second stage was powered by a liquid propellant.\n\nThe ALV X-1 was launched four times between 1957 and 1958, but all four launches were unsuccessful. The first launch failed due to a guidance system malfunction, while the second launch failed due to a fuel leak. The third launch failed due to a guidance system malfunction, and the fourth launch failed due to a fuel leak.\n\nThe ALV X-1 was designed to carry a payload of up to 100 kilograms.

It was the last model to be developed while the Alfa Romeo was still a fully independent company, before its merger into Fiat Group in 1986. The 164 was the first Alfa Romeo to be equipped with an independent suspension on all four wheels and a transaxle, a layout that would be used on all subsequent Alfa Romeo models.\n\nThe 164 was assembled at Alfa Romeo's Arese plant in Milan, Italy, and was also produced in a limited number in South Africa. The 164 was designed by Enrico Fumia of Pininfarina, and was styled in a sharp-edged, angular design, with a drag coefficient of 0.30. The 164 was the first Alfa Romeo to feature a double wishbone front suspension, and a rear suspension based on the De Dion principle.\n\nThe 164 was available with a range of petrol and diesel engines, ranging from a 2.0-litre four-cylinder to a 3.0-litre V6. The 164 was also available with a range of transmissions, including a five-speed manual, a four-speed automatic, and a three-speed semi-automatic.\n\nThe Alfa Romeo 164 was a popular car in Europe, and was praised for its handling and performance. It was also the first Alfa Romeo to be sold in the United States, where it was marketed as the Alfa Romeo Milano. The 164 was replaced by the Alfa Romeo 166 in 1998.",
