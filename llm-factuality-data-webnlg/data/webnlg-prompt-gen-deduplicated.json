In general, the closer an asteroid is to the sun, the shorter its orbital period will be. For example, the asteroid Ceres, which is the largest object in the asteroid belt, has an orbital period of around 4.6 Earth years because it is relatively close to the sun.

They can vary in size from small pebbles to large masses several hundred kilometers wide. Like planets, asteroids also orbit the sun in elliptical paths, which bring them closer and farther away from the sun at different points in their orbits.\n\nThe apoapsis, also known as the apogee, is the point in an asteroid's orbit that is farthest from the sun. At this point, the asteroid is moving slowest but has the greatest gravitational potential energy. The periaxis or perigee, on the other hand, is the closest point to the sun, where the asteroid is moving fastest.\n\nThe average speed of an asteroid depends on its distance from the sun and the strength of the gravitational forces acting upon it. Most asteroids travel through space at speeds between 10-30 kilometers per second.\n\nAs for the 1089 Tama asteroid, it is named after a town in Japan and was discovered by two Japanese astronomers in 1927. It is classified as a main-belt asteroid, which means it orbits the sun within the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Its precise characteristics, including its apoapsis and average speed, may vary depending on its distance from the sun and other factors, though.",

It was named after the Clematis flower, belonging to the buttercup family.\n\nAccording to the JPL Small-Body Database Browser, the semimajor axis of 1101 Clematis is 2.197 AU, and its eccentricity is 0.165. Its orbital period is about 3.25 years (or 1188.98 Earth days), and its inclination to the ecliptic is about 3.6 degrees. Its dimensions and shape are not well-determined, but it is estimated to have a diameter of 22 kilometers (or about 13 miles) and a rotation period of 9.9 hours.\n\nThe mass of 1101 Clematis is not precisely known, but it can be estimated from its orbit and other properties. Using the standard formula for the mass of an asteroid M = a\u00b3 / (P\u00b2G), where a is the semimajor axis in AU, P is the orbital period in years, and G is the gravitational constant, we can obtain an estimate of the mass of 1101 Clematis as about 7.25 x 10\u00b9\u2076 kg (or 8,000,000,000,000,000 kg). However, this estimate has a large uncertainty and should be treated cautiously.\n\nIn terms of its epoch, 1101 Clematis was last observed on October 14, 2018, at a distance of about 2.71 AU from the Sun. Its next predicted opposition (when it is closest to Earth and easiest to observe) is on May 23, 2021, at a distance of about 2.61 AU from Earth. During this event, it will have an apparent magnitude of about 10.4, which makes it difficult to observe with the naked eye but visible with moderate-sized telescopes.",

The mass of an asteroid determines its gravitational pull and, therefore, its impact potential if it were to collide with another object, such as a planet.\n\nThe apoapsis, or apogee, is the point in an asteroid's orbit that is farthest from the Sun. In contrast, the periaxis, or perigee, is the closest point in its orbit to the Sun.

The dessert is typically served warm, with the outside layer of meringue being crispy and the inside remaining cold and delicious.\n\nAlthough the origins of Baked Alaska are somewhat unclear, it is believed that the dessert was first created in the late 1800s by a chef named Charles Ranhofer at the famous Delmonico's restaurant in New York City. However, some sources suggest that the dessert might have been inspired by a similar dish served in France called \"omelette norv\u00e9gienne\".\n\nThe main ingredient used in Baked Alaska is ice cream, which is then combined with cake and meringue. The cake is typically sponge cake, but other types of cake can also be used. The meringue is made with egg whites, sugar, and cream of tartar, and is beaten to form stiff peaks. Once the meringue is ready, it is spread over the ice cream and cake, creating a layer that covers the entire dessert.\n\nBaked Alaska has become a popular dessert all over the world, and can be found in many different countries. It is typically served on special occasions, such as birthdays and holidays, and is always a crowd-pleaser.",

    "output": "\n\nAs an AI language model, I cannot give you the most updated information, but here is an explanation based on existing sources:\n\nAleksey Chirikov is an icebreaker that was built in Russia in the late 1970s. The ship was named after a Russian explorer, Aleksey Chirikov, who sailed to Alaska in 1741. The icebreaker was designed and built by the Finnish shipbuilder W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Helsinki Shipyard, which was one of the leading shipbuilding companies in the world at the time.\n\nThe ship's beam, meaning the width of the vessel at its widest point, is said to be around 20 meters. This makes it relatively wide for an icebreaker, which is designed to break ice by using the weight of the ship to crack the ice and then maneuvering through it.\n\nAleksey Chirikov was commissioned by the Soviet Union's Ministry of the Merchant Marine and was initially used for icebreaking operations in the Arctic Ocean. It was later transferred to Russia's Far East and used for icebreaking operations in the Sea of Okhotsk.\n\nThe ship has undergone several upgrades over the years to improve its icebreaking capabilities and to keep up with technological advances. It is currently operated by Far Eastern Shipping Company and is still in service as one of the largest and most powerful icebreakers in the Russian fleet.",

It is a tall, slender wooden post, painted black, and topped with a cross. The monument is believed to be about 700 years old, and its purpose has been debated by historians for centuries.\n\nSome people believe that the Dead Man's Plack was a marker for an ancient pilgrimage route that ran through the area. Others think that it may have been a waymarker for a nearby castle, or a memorial to someone who died in battle.\n\nThe most popular legend surrounding the Dead Man's Plack relates to a gruesome incident that allegedly occurred in the 14th century. According to the story, a monk was executed on this spot for breaking his monastic vows. His body was left hanging from the wooden post as a warning to others. The post was then painted black to symbolize the monk's sin.\n\nOver time, the monument became known as the Dead Man's Plack, and it has stood in the same spot ever since. The wooden post has been replaced several times over the centuries, but its basic design has remained the same.\n\nToday, the Dead Man's Plack is considered a historical treasure in Berkshire. It is a popular tourist attraction, and many people visit the site to try to unravel the mystery behind its origins.",

In 1942, he was captured by the Germans and sent to several prisoner of war camps, including the notorious Colditz Castle. Neave was one of the few prisoners to successfully escape from Colditz and was later awarded the Military Cross and the Croix de Guerre for his service during the war.\n\nAfter the war, Neave became a lawyer and was elected as a Member of Parliament for the Conservative Party in 1953. He served as a Member of Parliament for more than twenty years, holding several government positions including Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer and Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.\n\nNeave was also a strong advocate for human rights and was instrumental in helping to secure the release of Nelson Mandela from prison in South Africa. He was awarded a knighthood in 1974 and was posthumously awarded the George Cross, the highest civilian award in the United Kingdom, for his work in helping to combat terrorism.\n\nOverall, Airey Neave was a dedicated and courageous individual who played an important role in defending the freedom and democracy of his country and helping others around the world to do the same.",

In 1841, Fountain was appointed the vice president of the Republic of Texas under President Mirabeau B. Lamar, but he returned to the United States after the republic's demise due to financial difficulties.\n\nIn New Mexico, Fountain became a respected lawyer and rose to political prominence as a reformer, fighting against powerful political machines and corrupt officials in the territory. He also became known as a journalist and editor, founding the Las Cruces Rio Grande Republican newspaper and writing extensively about territorial politics.\n\nUnfortunately, Fountain's career was cut short when he and his eight-year-old son disappeared in 1896 while traveling from Las Cruces to Lincoln, New Mexico. The case attracted national attention and a massive manhunt, but their bodies were never found. It is widely believed that Fountain and his son were murdered by members of a gang of cattle rustlers and smugglers operating in the area.
