Asteroids come in various shapes and sizes, ranging from a few meters to several hundred kilometers in diameter. These space rocks can also vary in composition, some are made up of metal, while others are mostly rock or a mixture of both.\n\nThe maximum temperature of an asteroid depends on its distance from the sun and the albedo or reflectivity of its surface. When an asteroid gets closer to the sun, it heats up due to the radiation and absorbs more solar energy, which can make its surface temperature rise significantly. The temperature can also be affected by the asteroid's rotation rate, shape, and composition.\n\nApoapsis, on the other hand, refers to the point in an asteroid's orbit where it is farthest away from the sun (or any other celestial body it is orbiting). This term is commonly used in describing orbits of planets, moons, and other celestial objects.\n\nAgain, to obtain accurate and detailed information about a specific asteroid, it's best to consult reliable and authoritative sources in the field of astronomy.",

        "output": "\n\n(66391) 1999 KW4 is an asteroid that was discovered on May 20, 1999, by the LINEAR (Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research) program in New Mexico. It is classified as a near-Earth asteroid and has been deemed potentially hazardous due to its size and relatively close approach to Earth.\n\nEscape Velocity:\n\nEscape velocity is the speed at which an object needs to travel to break free from the gravitational pull of a larger body, like a planet or a star. For (66391) 1999 KW4, the escape velocity would depend on its mass and distance from the planet or star it is orbiting. However, as this asteroid approaches Earth at a distance of 0.038 AU (5.7 million km), its escape velocity would be much lower than the escape velocity required to break free from Earth's gravitational pull at the same distance, which is around 11.2 km/s.\n\nApoapsis:\n\nApoapsis is the point in an object's orbit where it is farthest from the body it is orbiting. For (66391) 1999 KW4, its orbit is highly elliptical, meaning it is not a perfect circle, and therefore has two apsides - the periapsis and apoapsis. According to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the asteroid's apoapsis is around 1.6 AU (240 million km) from the Sun, which would be outside the orbit of Mars.\n\nIn summary, (66391) 1999 KW4 is a potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroid with a low escape velocity relative to Earth and an elliptical orbit with an apoapsis beyond the orbit of Mars.",

The larger body of the asteroid is estimated to be about 1.3 kilometers (0.8 miles) in diameter, while the smaller body is about 0.5 kilometers (0.3 miles) in diameter.\n\nThe rotation period of 1999 KW4 is not precisely known, but it is estimated to be around 2.7 hours. The asteroid has an eccentric orbit that takes it from a distance of about 0.5 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun at its closest approach (perihelion) to about 3.2 AU at its farthest point (aphelion).\n\nAs with other asteroids, 66391 (1999 KW4) has the potential to pose a hazard to Earth, but it is not currently considered a threat.

However, based on my general knowledge as an AI language model, I can provide some information about asteroids and their orbital characteristics.\n\nAsteroids are small, rocky objects that orbit the sun. They are mainly found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, but some can be found closer to Earth or farther out in the solar system. Their orbital periods vary depending on their distance from the sun and their speed of orbit. The orbital period is the time it takes for an asteroid to complete one revolution around the sun.\n\nIf \"1000 Piazzia\" refers to an asteroid, then it would have a unique set of orbital characteristics. Its epoch would refer to the specific date and time that an observation was made or a prediction was made regarding its orbit. This information is important for accurately tracking and predicting the position of an asteroid in the sky.\n\nThe orbital period of an asteroid is determined by its distance from the sun and its velocity. In general, the closer an asteroid is to the sun, the shorter its orbital period will be. For example, the asteroid Ceres, which is the largest object in the asteroid belt, has an orbital period of around 4.6 Earth years because it is relatively close to the sun. On the other hand, asteroids that are farther from the sun, such as those in the Kuiper Belt, can have orbital periods that last hundreds or even thousands of Earth years.\n\nIn summary, without more information, it is difficult to provide specific details about \"1000 Piazzia\".

It was named after the Clematis flower, belonging to the buttercup family.\n\nAccording to the JPL Small-Body Database Browser, the semimajor axis of 1101 Clematis is 2.197 AU, and its eccentricity is 0.165. Its orbital period is about 3.25 years (or 1188.98 Earth days), and its inclination to the ecliptic is about 3.6 degrees. Its dimensions and shape are not well-determined, but it is estimated to have a diameter of 22 kilometers (or about 13 miles) and a rotation period of 9.9 hours.\n\nThe mass of 1101 Clematis is not precisely known, but it can be estimated from its orbit and other properties. Using the standard formula for the mass of an asteroid M = a\u00b3 / (P\u00b2G), where a is the semimajor axis in AU, P is the orbital period in years, and G is the gravitational constant, we can obtain an estimate of the mass of 1101 Clematis as about 7.25 x 10\u00b9\u2076 kg (or 8,000,000,000,000,000 kg). However, this estimate has a large uncertainty and should be treated cautiously.\n\nIn terms of its epoch, 1101 Clematis was last observed on October 14, 2018, at a distance of about 2.71 AU from the Sun. Its next predicted opposition (when it is closest to Earth and easiest to observe) is on May 23, 2021, at a distance of about 2.61 AU from Earth. During this event, it will have an apparent magnitude of about 10.4, which makes it difficult to observe with the naked eye but visible with moderate-sized telescopes.",

However, I can provide general information about asteroids and their characteristics, including mass and apoapsis.\n\nAsteroids are rocky or metallic bodies that orbit the Sun in the planetary system. They range in size from just a few meters to several hundred kilometers across. The mass of an asteroid determines its gravitational pull and, therefore, its impact potential if it were to collide with another object, such as a planet.\n\nThe apoapsis, or apogee, is the point in an asteroid's orbit that is farthest from the Sun. In contrast, the periaxis, or perigee, is the closest point in its orbit to the Sun. These measurements help to determine the shape and characteristics of the asteroid's orbit.\n\nWith regard to 110 Lydia, it is an asteroid that was discovered on August 19, 1870, by French astronomer Alphonse Borrelly. Its current mass and other specific characteristics are not readily available. However, it is known to have an eccentric orbit that brings it closer to the Sun than Mars at perihelion and far beyond Jupiter at aphelion, with an orbital period of 5.71 years. It belongs to the asteroid belt located between Mars and Jupiter.",

It also offered various trim levels and packages, such as the sporty \"X\" package and the luxury-oriented \"Barcelona\" package.\n\nThe Matador underwent several changes during its production run. In 1974, the car received a new front-end design, and in 1977, it was restyled with a sloping hood and new grille. The final year for the Matador was 1978, and production ended in August of that year.\n\nOverall, the AMC Matador was a solid performer and a reasonably popular car during its production run. However, it was largely overshadowed by more mainstream offerings from the Big Three automakers, and sales eventually began to decline. Today, the Matador has a small but dedicated following among classic car enthusiasts.",

The icebreaker was designed and built by the Finnish shipbuilder W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Helsinki Shipyard, which was one of the leading shipbuilding companies in the world at the time.\n\nThe ship's beam, meaning the width of the vessel at its widest point, is said to be around 20 meters. This makes it relatively wide for an icebreaker, which is designed to break ice by using the weight of the ship to crack the ice and then maneuvering through it.\n\nAleksey Chirikov was commissioned by the Soviet Union's Ministry of the Merchant Marine and was initially used for icebreaking operations in the Arctic Ocean. It was later transferred to Russia's Far East and used for icebreaking operations in the Sea of Okhotsk.\n\nThe ship has undergone several upgrades over the years to improve its icebreaking capabilities and to keep up with technological advances.

According to the story, a monk was executed on this spot for breaking his monastic vows. His body was left hanging from the wooden post as a warning to others. The post was then painted black to symbolize the monk's sin.\n\nOver time, the monument became known as the Dead Man's Plack, and it has stood in the same spot ever since. The wooden post has been replaced several times over the centuries, but its basic design has remained the same.\n\nToday, the Dead Man's Plack is considered a historical treasure in Berkshire.

He became known for his leading role in the Cape Frontier Wars. During the Fourth Frontier War, he was part of a group of Griqua who fought alongside the British in the battle of Boomplaats, where they defeated a force of Xhosa warriors. For his support, he was awarded land in Griqualand East and became the leader of the Griqua people in the region.\n\nIn 1862, his leadership was challenged by a rival Griqua leader, Nicolaas Waterboer, who sought to annex the Griqua territories to the British colony in the Cape. This led to the Griqua Wars, a series of conflicts that lasted for several years. Adam Kok eventually surrendered to British forces in 1865 and was exiled to the Cape Colony. He died there in 1875.",

Some believe that he was killed as part of a political conspiracy, while others think he was a victim of the notorious \"Cowboy\" faction of New Mexico. Fountain's body was never found, and the case remains unsolved.\n\nIn conclusion, Albert Jennings Fountain was a lawyer, politician, and prosecutor in New Mexico who disappeared under mysterious circumstances in 1896. While there is no evidence he served as Vice President, his legacy persists in the American West where he lived and worked.",

Many viewed him as a political opportunist who had abandoned his party and ideology for personal gain. Nevertheless, his impact on Texas politics was significant, and he remained a prominent figure in the state until his death in 1985.",
